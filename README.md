# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Insurance-Dataset
This project performs a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an insurance dataset to uncover key patterns, correlations, and insights that can inform future machine learning or predictive modeling work.

 **Objective:**

1) To understand the structure, quality, and behavior of the data by:

2) Checking data integrity (missing values, duplicates, outliers)

3) Exploring distributions of categorical and numerical features

4) Identifying relationships between independent variables and the response

**Key Insights:**

1) Dataset is well-structured with no missing values.

2) Strong class imbalance in the target variable — only ~16% positive responses.

3) Some features show clear separation patterns with respect to customer interest.

4) Feature encoding and resampling will be essential for downstream ML tasks.

 **Steps Covered:**

1) Data loading and inspection

2) Data cleaning and type validation

3) Univariate & bivariate analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib

4) Correlation and feature relationship mapping

5) Basic feature engineering ideas for modeling readiness

6) Visual summary and recommendations

**Tech Stack:**

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

 **Outcomes:**

This EDA provides a clear understanding of the insurance dataset, key influencing variables, and a data-driven base for model development.
Next steps include applying classification algorithms, handling imbalance, and deploying baseline ML models.
