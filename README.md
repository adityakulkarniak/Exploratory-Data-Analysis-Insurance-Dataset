# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Insurance-Dataset
This project performs a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an insurance dataset to uncover key patterns, correlations, and insights that can inform future machine learning or predictive modeling work.

 Objective

To understand the structure, quality, and behavior of the data by:

Checking data integrity (missing values, duplicates, outliers)

Exploring distributions of categorical and numerical features

Identifying relationships between independent variables and the response

Highlighting potential predictors for future modeling

 Key Insights

Dataset is well-structured with no missing values.

Strong class imbalance in the target variable — only ~16% positive responses.

Some features show clear separation patterns with respect to customer interest.

Feature encoding and resampling will be essential for downstream ML tasks.

 Steps Covered

Data loading and inspection

Data cleaning and type validation

Univariate & bivariate analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib

Correlation and feature relationship mapping

Basic feature engineering ideas for modeling readiness

Visual summary and recommendations

 Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

 Outcomes

This EDA provides a clear understanding of the insurance dataset, key influencing variables, and a data-driven base for model development.
Next steps include applying classification algorithms, handling imbalance, and deploying baseline ML models.

 How to Run
